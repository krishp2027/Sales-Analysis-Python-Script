### Project Title
Sales Analysis

### Introduction
This project involves analyzing sales data from an e-commerce store. The goal is to derive insights from the sales data, such as identifying sales trends, best-selling products, and the relationship between product prices and quantities ordered. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter notebook and the dataset is provided in a CSV file.

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

### Usage
To run the analysis, open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells sequentially:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `Sales_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells to load data, clean data, perform analysis, and visualize the results.

### Features
- **Loading Data**: Read the sales data from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and extract useful information.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform analysis to find monthly sales trends, best-selling products, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations such as bar charts and line plots to present the findings.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

### Configuration
No additional configuration is required. Ensure the CSV file (`all_data.csv`) is in the project directory or update the path in the notebook accordingly.

### Documentation
Detailed documentation for the functions and steps in the notebook can be found in the comments within the notebook itself.

### Examples
Examples of the analysis and visualizations can be found in the `Sales_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing Data**: Ensure the `all_data.csv` file is present in the correct directory.
- **Package Issues**: Verify all required packages are installed using the `pip install` command.
